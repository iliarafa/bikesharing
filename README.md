## Analysis Overview
This analysis aims to provide an extensive breakdown of bike trip analysis for investors who are looking to see if the bike-sharing program is a solid business proposal. 

## Results
Bike sharing is a fail safe business proposal. To prove this we will examine data from New York City's bike sharing program for the month of August. Looking at the first graph we see that most trips start and end in Midtown and Downtown. This declares the first major use of bike sharing.

Increased traffic is also observed in specific sites of Upper East and Upper West Side. We see the marks increase in size outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Gugggenheim Museum and the Natural History Museum. This in its turn is a result of tourists visiting major city sites.

Other areas of special interest are stations close to the Hudson River Greenway, Battery Park and the area around the World Trade Center. Sports facilities in the area together with a bike lane running the length of the river surely play a part in this. As far as other burroughs are concerned, there is less bike sharing traffic with the exceptions of Dumbo area in Brooklyn as well as Williamsburg and Greenpoint further north. Dumbo attracts mostly visitors to the city while in the case of Williamsburg and Greenpoint we are dealing with residents of the area who love biking and use the program for their daily needs.
